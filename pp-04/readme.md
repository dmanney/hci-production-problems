## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
  * ![Sketch}(Link to photo here)
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/apple-pencil/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  * In my sketch I've made sure to add a creative artistic element where users should be adable to adapt and draw in whatever frms they feel most comfortable should that be on their phone or some larger tablet better suited for drawing.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/branding/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: 
  * Brand aspects were added to this project basically by beginning with the focus on MCA. With the consitent MCA logo across each page the information is bound to stick with consumers.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/launch-screen/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: 
  *A launch screen has been implemented in my very first sketch where I'm asking users whether or not they'd like to draw something for a raffle selection.
