## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13U0u0kw0w0jyC+oRxVy4oIDfjr
Your Rationale: I'm a Sony fan so immediately PlayStation came to mind. With that I decided to go for a strong blue pallete as seen in most of their advertisements. I think keeping it on the lighter side makes it more attractive.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52P0s0kpPhOf-rRl4miuWcAG27E
Your Rationale: With a garden in mind the first color I thought of was green. I wanted to keep things a bit on the darker side as plant work does involve a lot of dirt and other not so attractive elements. 

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=34C1m0kpcG5eRQEksKUu+BJ-grg
Your Rationale: For children I wanted to make sure that the colors were all bright. From there I knew that I wanted to pick something fun that I loved as the focus, purple. 

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a014e0kuttK6QLga000j3asle3d
Your Rationale: I figured I'd keep things simple for this with a two color palette. Adding the white and black shades as elements contrasts with the red stealing the show. Having the constant two oppposing features represents security to me.
