## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. http://maxdesign.com.au/news/checklist/
2. https://it.toolbox.com/blogs/craigborysowich/gui-screen-design-checklist-111107

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Does the screen title identify the information in the current window or display the item name of the command button that invoked the window?
2. Are related menu items grouped together and visually separated by lines?
3. Are commonly used menu items placed at the top of the menu list?
4. Quality of code: Does the site use Valid HTML and CSS? Is the code well structured? Does the site have any broken links?
5. Accessibility for users: Does the site use relative units rather than absolute units for text size? Is there sufficient color brightness/contrasts?
6. Is the static text clear, concise, and meaningful?
7. Are radio buttons used to show sets of two or more mutually exclusive choices?
8. Are visited links clearly defined?
9. Is the site’s navigation easy to understand?
10. Is the site’s navigation consistent? Does the site use consistent and appropriate language?
